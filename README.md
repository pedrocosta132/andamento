Andamento is a remake of the app [Anda by Andante](https://linhandante.com/comprar/app-anda/), but without all the tech requirements and smartphone permitions. Only an internet connection is needed (and the camera optionally).

## Overview

### Context

The Anda application emulates the functionality of a physical card, necessitating NFC technology on the user's smartphone. Furthermore, it requires the continuous consent of location and Bluetooth access.
This project represents a personal endeavor dedicated to my exploration of mobile development within the React Native framework. It aims to serve as a minimalist yet illustrative application that underscores the feasibility of establishing a system, enhancing the user's quality of life through a mobile app, while safeguarding their personal information by minimizing permission requirements on the smartphone.
